<h1>Accident Radar</h1>
Accident Radar is an accident tracking system that provides the users with heatmaps of accidents in their vicinty. To generate the heatmaps we are currently using the Fort Lauderdale Accidents Open dataset obtained from namara.io but it can be easily extended for other cities as well.
The system also allows the users to check the accident heatmaps for particular days, particular roads and in particular weather conditions.<br>
The system will help the users to avoid (or at least be cautious in) accident prone zones , in case they are planning a trip to the city or just want to take a safe route home. It will also help the city officials get a visual idea of the accident patterns throughout the city, which will help them plan infrastructural improvements that will help minimize these accidents and help make the city a safer place.
